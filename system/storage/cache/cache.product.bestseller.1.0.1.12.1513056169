This fresh, smooth floral fragrance evokes sublime powdery rose. The effect is chic, comfortable, and entirely addictive. Top notes of pink peony, freesia, and lychee embody subtle freshness. At the heart, midnotes of magnolia flower, lily of the valley, and rose rise to sublimated femininity. A base of velvety elegance comes to fruition through cedarwood, amber, and honey. Inspired by the details in Chlo\u00e9's fashion, the flacon's heavy but softly curved and grooved glass reflects femininity and strength. The plated-silver top is embossed with the Chlo\u00e9 mark and adorned with a hand-tied ribbon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;","meta_title":"Chloe eau de parfum","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":"","tag":"Chloe","model":"Gold","sku":"","upc":"","ean":"","jan":"","isbn":"","mpn":"","location":"","quantity":"997","stock_status":"2-3 Days","image":"catalog\/demo\/product\/home2\/005.jpg","manufacturer_id":null,"manufacturer":null,"price":"300.0000","special":null,"reward":null,"points":"0","tax_class_id":"9","date_available":"2015-09-16","weight":"0.00000000","weight_class_id":"1","length":"0.00000000","width":"0.00000000","height":"0.00000000","length_class_id":"1","subtract":"1","rating":5,"reviews":"1","minimum":"1","sort_order":"1","status":"1","date_added":"2015-09-16 10:22:49","date_modified":"2016-04-13 16:12:53","viewed":"0"},"68":{"product_id":"68","name":"Singlepass professional","description":"&lt;p&gt;What it is: An award-winning T3\u00ae flatiron for smoothing and shaping world-class hair.
